This is a demo stock exchange game that was developed for YMCA's annual fest.
This application can be used by either extracting or forking in your local repo. Once you do that then move the files to your local server directory. You can use either Wamp or Xampp and after starting the server, you can see the application at http://localhost.

This repo currently does not include a database connection file. Make a file named '/php/connectdb.php'. Inside it define your database credentials.
Make a database in your local sql server and name it anything.
Rest sql files will be updated soon.
